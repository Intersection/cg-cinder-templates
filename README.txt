Cinder templates for Xcode 4. 

These are based on a set of stylistic conventions we use at Control Group, which are based very closely to Andrew Bell's style.

Obviously, this is only for Mac (soon, iOS) development with Cinder.

Clone this repo to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ - this will likely cause conflicts with any other templates you have created in that location - untested.
